I have created three files (HTML, Javascript and CSS) to help support the quiz game. The five questions are related specifically to JavaScript only. The countdown begins with 60 seconds and goes down to 0 from there. A number of variables were created and a few different functions used. The CSS file was used to format a few elements in the HTML document.
